Questions:

-Ask if precision and recall is correct
-evaluation on the clustering results or prediction or both?
-precision, recall, f-measure differ depending on the initial centroids of k-means, for the evaluation should I take the average of n trials?

-Sufficient to implement 2 algorithms? k-means and threshold
	-evaluate and compare
-3 experiments with different data size
-coding standards
-length of report
