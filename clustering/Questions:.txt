Questions:

-Ask if precision and recall is correct
-evaluation on the clustering results or prediction or both?
-precision, recall, f-measure differ depending on the initial centroids of k-means, for the evaluation should I take the average of n trials?
-k-means: choosing k as the number of labels --> ground truth
	- if k != number of classes: how to compute precision, recall, f-measure? --> The size of the set of true labels and the clusters is different

-Should I implement thresholding algo or k-means++?

-3 experiments with different data size
-coding standards
-length of report
