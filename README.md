A Comparison of Facial Feature Extraction Methods based on Professional Domain Clustering

Motivated by researches in the social sciences and computational methods,
the correlation between facial features and professional talents are examined
using face clustering. Face clustering is a technique that groups similar faces
together based on their feature representations. Therefore, obtaining a robust
and discriminative face embedding for this task is essential. In this paper, four
open-source state-of-the-art feature extraction methods and common clustering
algorithms are compared by their accuracy to cluster faces based on the personâ€™s
professional domain. The results show that there is a slight correlation between
facial features and professional talents and that a combination of FaceNet and
K-Means or EM clustering yield good clustering results.
