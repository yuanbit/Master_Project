%\begin{abstract}
%Bitcoin as an electronic payment system prevents the double-spending problem using the Proof-of-Work confirmation protocol. However, security issues arise with fast payments using Bitcoin as merchants are required to exchange their goods in a short time. We examine double-spending attacks on fast-payments and show how the attacks can be executed. Moreover, we demonstrate how the countermeasures by Bitcoin developers are either ineffective or produce additional costs for the merchants. Ultimately, we present an easy and lightweight solution for the dection of double-spending attacks in fast payments.
